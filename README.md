# 💡 Optimization of Flight Operations 💡


## About The Project
🔥 This project focuses on analyzing flight delay patterns in the United States by utilizing various metrics and statistical tests to identify the primary causes of delays. By examining historical flight data, this study aims to uncover trends, seasonal variations, and key influencing factors that contribute to delays. The insights gained from this analysis will serve as a foundation for developing data-driven strategies to improve flight punctuality. Ultimately, the project seeks to provide actionable recommendations for airlines and aviation authorities to optimize operational efficiency and reduce flight delays within the next year.
